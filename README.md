# Responsive-web-app
This is a practice project where I'm building a responsive web app using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to improve my full-stack development skills. It features a fully responsive design, CRUD operations with MongoDB, and a RESTful API. The goal is to learn and refine my skills. ðŸš€
